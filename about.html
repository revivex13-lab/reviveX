        <h1>About the ReViveX Project</h1>
        <p>
          ReViveX is an undergraduate software development group project
          developed as part of the University of Westminster curriculum. The
          project focuses on addressing real-world challenges in
          neurorehabilitation through a practical, technology-driven solution.

          <h3>Project Background</h3>
          <p>
            Neurological conditions such as stroke often require long-term
            rehabilitation involving both physical and cognitive therapy. In
            many regions, including Sri Lanka, access to continuous
            rehabilitation services is limited due to cost, infrastructure, and
            availability of trained professionals.

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
          <p>
            Existing rehabilitation solutions are frequently expensive,
            clinic-dependent, and difficult to scale. Patients may struggle with
            adherence due to repetitive exercises and lack of engagement, while
            clinicians face challenges in monitoring progress outside clinical
            settings.

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Proposed Solution</h3>
          <p>
            ReViveX proposes a low-cost, interactive neurorehabilitation system
            that combines sensor-based hardware with gamified software. The
            system enables home-based therapy while allowing clinicians to
            monitor objective performance metrics remotely.

        <h2>Academic Context</h2>
        <p>
          This project was developed under the module
          <strong>5COSC021C.Y – Software Development Group Project</strong>. It
          represents a collaborative effort by undergraduate students to apply
          software engineering principles, user-centred design, and
          problem-solving skills to a socially impactful domain.
        </p>
        <p>
          The development process included requirements analysis, system design,
          implementation, testing, and documentation, following established
          software development practices.
