        <h1>ReViveX System Overview</h1>
        <p>
          The ReViveX system is designed as an integrated neurorehabilitation
          solution combining a sensor-enabled physical device with a software
          platform that supports interactive therapy and progress monitoring.

          <h3>Therapy Device</h3>
          <p>
            The primary physical component of ReViveX is a soft, air-filled
            therapy ball embedded with pressure sensors. The device is designed
            to accommodate users with limited grip strength and reduced motor
            control.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sensor readings are captured in real time and transmitted to the
            software platform for analysis and feedback.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Sensor Integration</h3>
          <p>
            The system utilises pressure and motion sensing to measure grip
            strength, response timing, and interaction accuracy. These metrics
            provide objective insight into both physical and cognitive
            performance during therapy sessions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sensor calibration ensures consistency across sessions and supports
            longitudinal progress tracking.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h3>Software Platform</h3>
          <p>
            The software component delivers guided therapy exercises through an
            interactive interface. Exercises are structured to combine physical
            interaction with cognitive tasks such as memory, attention, and
            reaction-based challenges.
          </p>
          <p>
            Session data is stored securely and made available for clinical
            review.

        <h2>Accessibility and Usability</h2>
        <p>
          Accessibility is a core design consideration of ReViveX. The system
          supports multiple languages, including English, Sinhala, and Tamil,
          ensuring usability across diverse user groups.
        </p>
        <p>
          The interface is designed with simple navigation, clear visual
          feedback, and minimal cognitive load to accommodate users with varying
          levels of impairment.

        <h2>Data and Security Considerations</h2>
        <p>
          User performance data is collected for the purpose of monitoring
          rehabilitation progress. The system architecture is designed to ensure
          data integrity and controlled access, allowing clinicians to review
          relevant metrics while maintaining patient confidentiality.
        </p>
        <p>
          All collected data is intended for academic and clinical evaluation
          within the scope of the project.
